INSOB
Overview
INSOB (Infinite Notes on a Scrollable Bible) is a Bible note-taking application that offers users an infinite canvas for jotting down notes, thoughts, and reflections as they study the Bible. The app features drag-and-drop functionality and editable text boxes, making it easy for users to organize their notes visually.

Problem
Many existing Bible study tools and note-taking applications are constrained by limited space and rigid organizational structures. Users often struggle with the inability to freely move and edit their notes in a manner that mirrors their thought processes. INSOB addresses these pain points by providing an infinite canvas, allowing for more natural and flexible note-taking.

Users will drag and drop text boxes onto an infinite canvas to create and organize their notes as they study different Bible passages.
Users will zoom and pan across the canvas to navigate through their notes seamlessly.
Users will edit text boxes directly on the canvas to update their notes.
Special Considerations:

The app must be intuitive and easy to use for people of all ages.
It should support various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Accessibility features should be considered to ensure that users with disabilities can use the app effectively.
